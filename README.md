# Coffee App ☕ – Portfolio Demo

This project is a simplified version of a real-world application, adapted specifically for use in my professional portfolio. Due to confidentiality, certain aspects have been modified or removed, and the full codebase is not publicly available.

## 📱 About the Project

This is a mobile coffee shop app built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) (React Native). It allows users to:

- Browse a list of coffee drinks
- View detailed information about each product
- Add items to a cart
- Adjust quantities and checkout
- Get toast notifications for feedback
- Navigate through multiple screens

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React Native** (with Expo)
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **expo-router** for navigation
- **react-native-toast-message** for feedback
- **Ionicons** for icons
- **react-native-safe-area-context** for safe view rendering
